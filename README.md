# Snakes & Ladders Game
This app is the classic Snakes and Ladders board game, built in React.js

## Snakes & Ladders rules:

### Setup
Before the game starts, each player will roll a die, the player who rolls a 6, will be allowed to start the game.

### Start
After each roll, based on the number of the die, the players will move.  
They move their pieces from left to right, starting at 1, following the numbers on the board; then the next row from right to left, and repeat.

### Snakes
When a player lands on the top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake.

### Ladders
When a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder.

### Winner
The first player that reaches the highest cell on the board, 100, wins the game. To win, the player will need to roll the exact number to get them to the last cell. If the player rolls a higher number than needed to land exactly on 100, their piece does not move and remains there until their next turn, when they can roll again.
